# Stencils

Our stencils are formatted to be traced, cut out and then painted rapidly.  Creating a template takes a little time... but once you have one made... cranking out dozens of signs is super fast. 

- There are lots of ways to enlarge these for use on signs.  
- The easiest method is to use a projector.
- No projector?  No prob! You can also "tile print" it on 8.5x11 sheets of paper with Adobe Reader.  Just select Print -> Poster ->Set Scale.
